# Sanjay-Travels_Project
This project is about a complete travels management portal in which all the vehicles will start from lovely professional university specially for students.
Actually you can see and analyze the code but if you want to execute the code it's very difficult because you have to create the database in your pc and have to update your pgadmin password in the code to get access to your pgadmin. Even you did that you have to create the tables of same names and constraints in that database as i created, to observe the complete functionality of the project. So to avoid all these difficulties I have made a video which shows you all the features of project in the below link. So if you wish to see its working you can watch the video below. You are completely free to use the algorithms that I have used in the project because many of the algorithms are very complex like mail validation function and others.


This is the video link. The video is only intended for showing the working of my project.
